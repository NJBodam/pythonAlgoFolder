# Project Instructions
# The LAPD has asked you to help them by finding answers to the following questions:

# Which hour has the highest frequency of crimes? Store as an integer variable called peak_crime_hour.
# Which area has the largest frequency of night crimes (crimes committed between 10pm and 4am)? Save as a string variable called peak_night_crime_location.
# Identify the number of crimes committed against victims by age group (<18, 18-25, 26-34, 35-44, 45-54, 55-64, 65+). Save as a pandas Series called

# You have been asked to support the Los Angeles Police Department (LAPD) by analyzing crime data to identify patterns in criminal behavior. They plan to use your insights to allocate resources effectively to tackle various crimes in different areas.

# The Data
# They have provided you with a single dataset to use. A summary and preview are provided below.

# It is a modified version of the original data, which is publicly available from Los Angeles Open Data.

# crimes.csv
